Crash Course on Everything
==========================

This page provides a high-level overview of what you need to know in order to 
accelerate ML models with the CFU Playground. 

Hint: Broad knowledge over the whole stack is more useful than deep knowledge 
of any one part. Although each of these topics is very interesting in itself, it
is better to learn the basics for each area and start applying them, and later
work out where the gaps in your knowledge may be.

* C and C++ for Microcontrollers
* Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers 
* RISCV and CFUs
* Writing gateware with Verilog and nMigen
* LiteX and SoCs.
* Getting help.
