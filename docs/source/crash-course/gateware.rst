Building FPGA Gateware with Verilog and nMigen
==============================================

Field Programmable Gate Arrays are fascinating devices that can efficiently
perform all kinds of computing tasks. A configuration for and FPGA is known as
'gateware'.

There are a variety of ways to configure FPGAs. Verilog is perhaps the most
well known and best supported. Learning Verilog is good way to begin to
understand how FPGAs work.

It is possible to write CFUs in Verilog, but for more sophisticated CFUs we use
nMigen to generate Verilog.
